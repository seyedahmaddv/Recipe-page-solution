## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (CSS Variables)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Young Serif & Outfit)
- Responsive design principles

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my knowledge of several key concepts:

**CSS Custom Properties**: Using CSS variables for consistent color management throughout the project made the design system more maintainable.

```css
:root {
  --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  --stone-100: hsl(30, 54%, 90%);
  --rose-800: hsl(332, 51%, 32%);
}
```

**Semantic HTML Structure**: Implementing proper semantic elements like `<main>`, `<section>`, and appropriate heading hierarchy for better accessibility.

```html
<main class="recipe-card">
  <section class="ingredients">
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!-- content -->
  </section>
</main>
```

**Custom List Styling**: Creating custom bullet points and numbered lists using CSS pseudo-elements:

```css
.ingredients li::before {
  content: "â€¢";
  color: var(--brown-800);
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
}
```

**Responsive Design**: Implementing mobile-first approach with media queries to ensure the design works well across different screen sizes.

### Continued development

Areas I want to continue focusing on in future projects:

- **CSS Grid**: While this project used Flexbox effectively, I want to explore more complex layouts using CSS Grid
- **Advanced CSS animations**: Adding subtle micro-interactions to enhance user experience
- **Accessibility improvements**: Implementing better screen reader support and keyboard navigation
- **Performance optimization**: Optimizing images and CSS for better loading times
